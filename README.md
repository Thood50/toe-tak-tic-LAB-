<h1>Toe-Tak-Tic</h1>

<h2>Summary: </h2>
Welcome to my creation of the infamous game TicTacToe.  All in all its very simple concept.  You and a friend input your names and play!  The goal is to get three in a row.  The first player to input their name will be "X"'s and the second player will be "O"'s!
